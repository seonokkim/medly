# 🩺 Medly Project

Medly is an AI-powered medical consultation system designed to bridge the communication gap between patients and healthcare professionals. It integrates:
	•	Speech-to-Text (STT) for voice input,
	•	Summarization to condense lengthy medical explanations, and
	•	a RAG-based chatbot to deliver personalized, context-aware responses before and after surgery.

This project is a full-stack team project that integrates a mobile frontend, backend APIs, machine learning capabilities, and report generation. The project is designed to explore and demonstrate a modular architecture for building LLM-powered healthcare applications.
